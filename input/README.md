# About this directory

This directory contains the puzzle input. If you're cloning this repository, you should download and provide your own input notes here.

The programs expect the data for day `D` (0-padded if it's less than 10) to be in a file `{D}`, with no file extension. For example, the input notes for day 7 should be in `07`. This can be changed by modifying `inputFolder` and `fileOfDayPart` in [`AoCUtils.lean`](../AoC2025/Utils/AoCUtils.lean).
